## Project Overview

This project focuses on the creation of a comprehensive blood proteomics disease atlas, using machine learning to identify disease-specific biomarkers. The primary goal is to analyze patterns across multiple diseases and contribute to the understanding of proteomic signatures that are uniquely associated with particular diseases. 

## Data Description

The data used in this project consists of blood proteomics profiles obtained from various sources, including clinical studies, public databases, and collaborations with research institutions. 

- **Source of Data**: [Link to data sources or references]
- **Data Format**: Describe the data structure, e.g., CSV, HDF5, etc.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Mention any preprocessing steps taken before analysis, such as normalization, imputation, etc.
